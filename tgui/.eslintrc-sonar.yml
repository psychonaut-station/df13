  # ? Modified some rules because:
  # This rule should be used as default by everybody writing code, but in some cases readability is more important
  # radar/no-duplicate-string: error
  # Same as above, some switches are just created to enchance readability and make extending functionalities easier
  # radar/no-small-switch: error
  # Lack of jumps can have more severe outcomes sometimes than little reedundant amount of these
  # radar/no-redundant-jump: error
  # This is just a shitshow, you ain't gonna create anonymouse function every time you want to sort
  # radar/no-identical-functions: error
  # This is disabled due to some wacky redux event dispatchers. Redux is complicated and could overwrite that store function later, so don't wanna touch it, but sonar is crying
